## Vertex AI and Vertex AI Search&Conversation

Let's dive into Generative AI products in Google Cloud what each one has to offer and why you might choose one over another to provide a particular solution.



Google has two mainn types of Generative AI products: there are **Consumer Products** such as ***Bard*** or ***MakerSuite*** which are like a supercharged version of the Google search bar. 

Consumer products are there for anyone to access with a consumer product such as Bard you can ask questions like "help me plan a 3-day trip to Patagonia" and Bard will generate a precise and informative answer based on a huge amount of data. Your customers may ask you "when can I get access to Bard" you need to make sure that the customer understands that Bard is a consumer product. It's important to understand that Bard uses **GmAIl** as the login and the data that you put into Bard is owned by Google and used to improve Bard. Additionally Bard is trained on large collections of data that may or may not be compatible with what you want to do with it in an Enterprise.

However Google Cloud builds **Enterprise Products** Vertex AI and Vertex AI search and conversation cater to Enterprises who are concerned with how to control access to data have you heard that some large investment banks are shutting off their employees access to Consumer AI products they were concerned about what their employees were asking and what information they were sharing.

Using Enterprise Products gives you control of your data the data is controlled and governed differently than the consumer-based products. You don't want other organizations to know what data your LLMs are being trained on or have access to that data or to know about the output fraud and security are really important in regulated. Industries like banking or Healthcare, it's necessary to prove how you provided an answer queries using Enterprise data sources must be grounded in facts. Google Cloud provides solutions for these concerns and gives you access to state-of-the-art models as they roll out providing easy integration into your existing data and applications without having to build new connections. 

As an Enterprise customer you also have the option to match the model size and characteristics to what you want to achieve and there's explAInability and Responsible AI and other pieces built into it as part of the platform. 

So let's talk about ***what differentiates*** Vertex AI and Vertex AI Search&Conversation.

Vertex AI provides Generative AI APIs that provide end-to-end support across multiple modalities. In **model garden** you can access a wide variety of APIs, Foundation models and open-source models that can easily call upon pre-trAIn models to quickly solve real world problems and with **Generative AI Studio**, developers can tune and deploy Foundation models for their use cases by simply using a web interface. 

Using Vertex AI you can easily train, test, monitor, deploy and govern ML models at scale. This reduces the amount of work you need to do to maintain model performance and production. It also enables AI practitioners to focus on writing Innovative code. 

Vertex AI Search&Conversation enables fast application development by leveraging the power of ready out-of-the-box tunable and multimodal models. It also offers immersive Conversational AI experiences that are both natural and transactional and they're easily accessed and applied using Enterprise Foundation models with Enterprise controls.

So if you an Enterprise looking for a Generative AI solution how do you decide which product to use. It's quite simple. 
Once you've decided that your solution requires Generative AI you need to answer the question can this be solved with an out-of-the-box **(OOTB)** use case.

If the answer is ***YES*** then Vertex AI search and conversation is the solution for you. <br/>
If the answer is ***NO*** then you may require more customized and refined Solutions built inhouse using Vertex AI with Generative AI support.

Chat, search and Generative AI independently add a lot of value to the Enterprise. 

Vertex AI conversation is wonderful when you can have humanlike interactions to solve problems and find information Vertex AI search is useful when you can scale a wide range of siloed data to retrieve accurate and trusted information. Generative AI is quickly becoming the path ***to creating new content and experiences*** to excite your customers. Customizing, tuning and training Generative AI models has never been more important to provide a safe experience and bringing these capabilities together enables Enterprise developers to build even more delightful user experiences.

Google Cloud wants to offer developers the best-in-class platform for building these immersive conversational experiences with a fast time to value and a high quality at scale and whereas Vertex AI will require dedicated AI practitioners to implement an Enterprise solution.

With Vertex AI search and conversation developers and business users can create applications that serve particular business needs.
