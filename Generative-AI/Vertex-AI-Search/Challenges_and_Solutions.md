# Challenges

There are three main challenges when implementing a search service for an Enterprise.


**First** the service level requirements for any Enterprise search service is high. Most organizations don't have the time or budget to build a service that is capable of handling large amounts of data in a wide variety of formats all while being scalable and available 24/7.

**Second** Challenge is that traditional keyword search is too restricted especially for users who are familiar with AI powered search and recommendations on social media platforms and other apps. These experience audiences are standard today but it's much more difficult to implement. 

**Third** challenge is how to take advantage of Generative AI and LLMs that are the Pinnacle of information retrieval technology. Vertex AI Search and Conversation from Google Cloud provides a simple to set up service that unifies all this information together and makes it easy to find. Vertex AI searching conversation supports creating search engines and chat interfaces.
