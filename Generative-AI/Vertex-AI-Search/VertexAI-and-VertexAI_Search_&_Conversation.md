## Vertex AI and Vertex AI Search&Conversation

Let's dive into Generative AI products in Google Cloud what each one has to offer and why you might choose one over another to provide a particular solution.

Google has two main types of generative AI products: there are **consumer products** such as ***Bard*** or ***MakerSuite*** which are like a supercharged version of the Google search bar. Consumer products are there for anyone to access with a consumer product such as Bard you can ask questions like "help me plan a 3-day trip to Patagonia" and Bard will generate a precise and informative answer based on a huge amount of data. Your customers may ask you "when can I get access to Bard" you need to make sure that the customer understands that Bard is a consumer product. It's important to understand that Bard uses **Gmail** as the login and the data that you put into Bard is owned by Google and used to improve Bard. Additionally Bard is trained on large collections of data that may or may not be compatible with what you want to do with it in an Enterprise. 

However Google Cloud builds **Enterprise Products** vertex Ai and vertex AI search and conversation cater to Enterprises who are concerned with how to control access to data have you heard that some large investment banks are shutting off their employees access to Consumer AI products they were concerned about what their employees were asking and what information they were sharing.

Using Enterprise Products gives you control of your data the data is controlled and governed differently than the consumer-based products. You don't want other organizations to know what data your LLMs are being trained on or have access to that data or to know about the output fraud and security are really important in regulated. Industries like banking or Healthcare, it's necessary to prove how you provided an answer queries using Enterprise data sources must be grounded in facts. Google Cloud provides solutions for these concerns and gives you access to state-of-the-art models as they roll out providing easy integration into your existing data and applications without having to build new connections. 

As an Enterprise customer you also have the option to match the model size and characteristics to what you want to achieve and there's explainability and Responsible AI and other pieces built into it as part of the platform. 

So let's talk about ***what differentiates*** Vertex AI and Vertex AI Search&Conversation.

Vertex AI provides Generative AI APIs that provide end-to-end support across multiple modalities. In **model garden** you can access a wide variety of APIs, Foundation models and open-source models that can easily call upon pre-train models to quickly solve real world problems and with **Generative AI Studio**, developers can tune and deploy Foundation models for their use cases by simply using a web interface. Using Vertex AI you can easily
