# Google Cloud Workshops

This repo is mainly for sharing information to enable customers to gain insights from data which is located in BigQuery and Cloud Storage. <br/>

You can copy and paste shared queries and codes to get quick insights from public datasets by using your own Google Cloud account. <br/>


The benefit we see in doing these exercises is to show you what insights you can access with your data that you have already stored in BigQuery, or if your data is stored in bigquery, what insights you can access if it is secured, and what an dtaa pipeline on the complete Google Cloud can gain you. <br/>

As NGC, we promise that we will always support you to use Google Cloud products effectively in your data adventure. We are ready to offer you the unique solutions of Google Cloud so that you can extract insights from your data of any size.
