# What is computer vision?

Computer Vision is a subfield of artificial intelligence focused on deriving insight from visual inputs, such as digital images or videos.

  - Subfield of AI
  - Focused on deriving insight from visial inputs
  - Machines can take actions using these visial inputs

Although capturing an image in a digital form began in the 1960s, research on configuring computers to understand, the subject matter or the meaning of all those pixels has only progressed in the last few decades. And it is only within the last few years, with the advent of cloud computing, and specialized processors designed for computer vision, that this technology can be leveraged at scale.

This advancement is primarily because every image can be represented as 2-dimensional arrays of numbers, which are known as pixels. Computer vision has also experienced growth because of the mass amounts of data generated now which allow researchers to train computer vision models.

In 2002, the first phones with built-in cameras became publicly available. By 2006, more than half of all phones had integrated cameras. Now, mobile technology with built-in cameras has saturated the world with visual inputs like digital images and videos.
