Although capturing an image in a digital form began in the 1960s, research on configuring computers to understand, the subject matter or the meaning of all those pixels has only progressed in the last few decades. And it is only within the last few years, with the advent of cloud computing, and specialized processors designed for computer vision, that this technology can be leveraged at scale.

This advancement is primarily because every image can be represented as 2-dimensional arrays of numbers, which are known as pixels. Computer vision has also experienced growth because of the mass amounts of data generated now which allow researchers to train computer vision models.

In 2002, the first phones with built-in cameras became publicly available. By 2006, more than half of all phones had integrated cameras. Now, mobile technology with built-in cameras has saturated the world with visual inputs like digital images and videos.

Internet growth statistics from Statista show that the total amount of data consumed globally in 2021 was 79 zettabytes and 93% of people accessed the internet through mobile devices.

A ‘byte’ is a unit of digital storage capacity, and a zettabyte is 10 to the 21st bytes.

Considering that the phones in your pockets can capture high-resolution images, the amount of visual data is even more impressive.

To give you another sense of the scale of visual data, consider that for every second that passes, 8.5 hours of videos are uploaded to YouTube. That’s 500 hours of video data for every minute.

As of November 2020, 4 trillion photos were stored in Google Photos, and every week, 28 billion new photos and videos are uploaded. This number roughly corresponds to 46,300 visual inputs per second.

# What kind of problems can you solve with computer vision?

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that enables machines to interpret and make decisions based on visual data. There are various problems and applications that can be addressed using computer vision, and the Google Vision API offers additional benefits in this regard. Here are some problems that computer vision can solve, along with the extra benefits of the Google Vision API:

Image Classification: Computer vision can classify images into different categories. This is useful in scenarios where you want to automatically categorize or label images.

Object Detection: Detecting and locating objects within an image or video stream. This is commonly used in surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and robotics.

Facial Recognition: Identifying and verifying individuals based on facial features. It is used in security systems, authentication, and social media applications.

Image Segmentation: Dividing an image into segments to identify and understand the different objects and regions within it. This is helpful in medical imaging, autonomous vehicles, and industrial applications.

OCR (Optical Character Recognition): Extracting text from images or documents. This is used in digitizing printed documents, recognizing license plates, and more.

Gesture Recognition: Understanding and interpreting gestures made by humans. This is applicable in virtual reality, gaming, and human-computer interaction.

Medical Image Analysis: Analyzing medical images for diagnosis and treatment planning. It includes tasks like tumor detection, organ segmentation, and pathology analysis.

Anomaly Detection: Identifying unusual patterns or deviations in visual data. This is crucial for quality control in manufacturing and surveillance applications.

## The Google Vision API offers several extra benefits:

Ease of Use: The API is easy to integrate into applications, requiring minimal coding effort.

**Pre-Trained Models:** Google Vision API comes with pre-trained models for various tasks, allowing developers to leverage powerful models without training them from scratch.

**Scalability:** The API is designed to handle large-scale applications, making it suitable for a wide range of use cases.

**Diverse Image Analysis:** It supports a variety of image analysis features, including label detection, face detection, text detection, and more.

**Cloud-Based:** The API is hosted on Google Cloud, providing the advantages of cloud computing, including scalability, accessibility, and reliability.

**Integration with Other Google Cloud Services:** It can be easily integrated with other Google Cloud services, allowing for a comprehensive and seamless solution.

Keep in mind that while Google Vision API is a powerful tool, the choice of a computer vision solution depends on specific project requirements, and there are other APIs and frameworks available for similar tasks.
