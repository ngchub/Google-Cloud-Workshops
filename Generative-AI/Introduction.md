# What is Generative AI?
Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can create new content, such as text, images, audio, and video. It does this by learning from existing data and then using that knowledge to generate new and unique outputs.

Generative AI is a subset of Deep Learning.

Large language models are also a subset of deep learning.

## Discriminative vs. Generative Technique

![discriminative_generative_tech](https://github.com/ngchub/Google-Cloud-Workshops/assets/28653377/674d22dc-d8c5-4447-af8b-38f52fc40a76)

The discriminative model learns the conditional probability distribution or the probability of y, our output, given x, our input, that this is a dog and classifies it as a dog and not a cat.

The generative model learns the joint probability distribution or the probability of x and y and predicts the conditional probability that this is a dog and can then generate a picture of a dog.

So to summarize, generative models can generate new data instances while discriminative models discriminate between different kinds of data instances.

  - GenAI is a type of artificial intelligence that creates new content based on what it has learned from existing content. <br/>

  - The process of learning from existing content is called training and results in the creation of a ***statistical model***.

  - When given a promt. GenAI uses this ***statistical model*** to predict what an expected response might be- and this generates new content.

## When an input is image or text

A generative image model takes an image as input and can output text, another image, or video. For example, under the output text, you can get visual question answering while under output image, an image completion is generated. And under output video, animation is generated. 


A generative language model takes text as input and can output more text, an image, audio, or decisions. For example, under the output text, question answering is generated. And under output image, a video is generated.

## What is a prompt?
A prompt is a short piece of text that is given to the large language model as input, and it can be used to control the output of the model in many ways.

## What is an example of both a generative AI model and a discriminative AI model?
A generative AI model could be trained on a dataset of images of cats and then used to generate new images of cats. A discriminative AI model could be trained on a dataset of images of cats and dogs and then used to classify new images as either cats or dogs.

## What are foundation models in Generative AI?
A foundation model is a large AI model pretrained on a vast quantity of data that was "designed to be adapted‚Äù (or fine-tuned) to a wide range of downstream tasks, such as sentiment analysis, image captioning, and object recognition.

<h3> 
Hallucinations are words or phrases that are generated by the model that are often nonsensical or grammatically incorrect. What are some factors that can cause hallucinations?  </h3>
