# Responsible AI

As AI becomes more common, many technologies that aren't AI enabled may start to seem inadequate.
Now, AI systems are enabling computers to see, understand, and interact with the world in ways that were unimaginable just a decade ago.
These systems are developing at an extraordinary pace.

Yet, despite these remarkable advancements, AI is not **infallible**.

Technology is a reflection of what exist in society.

Without good practices, AI may replicate existing issues or bias and amplify them.

## Definition of Responsible AI

There isn't a universal definition of responsible AI, nor is there a simple checklist or formula that defines how responsible AI practices should be implemented.
Instead, organizations are developing their own AI principles that reflect their mission and values.

While these principles are unique to every organization, if you look for common themes, you find a consistent set of ideas across **transparency**, **fairness**, **accountability**, and **privacy**.

Google's approach to responsible AI is rooted in a commitment, to strive towards AI that's built for everyone that's accountable and safe, that respects privacy, and that is driven by scientific excellence.Google has developed its own AI principles, practices, governance processes, and tools that together embody its values and guide its approach to responsible AI.

Google has incorporated responsibility by design into its products, and even more importantly its organization.

Google all has a role to play in how responsible AI is applied. Whatever stage in the AI process you're involved with, from **design** to **deployment** or **application**, the decisions you make have an impact. Therefore, it's important that you too have a <ins>defined</ins> and <ins>repeatable</ins> process for using AI responsibly.

There's a common misconception with artificial intelligence that machines play the central decision-making role. 

In reality, it's people who design and build these machines, and decide how they're used.
People are involved in each aspect of AI development.
They collect or create the data that the model is trained on.
They control the deployment of the AI and how it's applied in a given context.
Essentially, human decisions are threaded throughout our technology products.
Every time a person makes a decision, they're actually making a choice based on their own values.
Whether it's the decision to use generative AI to solve a problem as opposed to other methods, or anywhere throughout the machine learning life cycle, that person introduces their own set of values.

This means that every decision point requires **consideration** and **evaluation** to ensure that choices have been made **responsibly** from concept through deployment and maintenance.

Because there's potential to impact many areas of society, not to mention people's daily lives, it's important to develop these technologies with ethics in mind.

Responsible AI doesn't mean to focus only on the obviously controversial use cases.

***Without Responsible AI practices, even seemingly innocuous AI use cases, or those with good intent could still cause ethical issues or unintended outcomes, or not be as beneficial as they could be.***

Ethics and responsibility are important, not least because they represent the right thing to do, but also because they can guide AI designed to be more beneficial for people's lives.

Google has learned that building responsibility into any AI deployment makes better models and builds trust with our customers and our customers customers. 

![chrome-capture-2023-9-10 (5)](https://github.com/ngchub/Google-Cloud-Workshops/assets/28653377/58e49d24-88f6-417c-ac45-963c109c254b)

If at any point in that trust is broken, we run the risk of AI deployment is being stalled, unsuccessful, or at worst harmful to stakeholders those products affect.


***This all fits into Google belief that responsible AI equals successful AI.***


While AI principles help ground a group in shared commitments, not everyone will agree with every decision made about how products should be designed responsibly.This is why it's important to develop robust processes that people can trust. Even if they don't agree with the end decision, they trust the process that drove the decision.

## & AI Principles at Google

In June 2018, Google announced seven AI principles to guide its work.
These are concrete standards that actively govern its research and product development and affect its business decisions.
1. **AI should be socially beneficial**: Any project should take into account a broad range of social and economic factors, and Google will proceed only where we believe that the overall likely benefits substantially exceed the foreseeable risks and downsides.
2. **AI should avoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias.**: Google seek to avoid unjust effects on people, particularly those related to sensitive characteristics, such as race, ethnicity, gender, nationality, income, sexual orientation, ability, and political or religious belief.
3. **AI should be built and tested for safety.**: Google will continue to develop and apply strong safety and security practices to avoid unintended results that create risks of home.
4. **AI should be accountable to people.**: Google will design AI systems that provide appropriate opportunities for feedback, relevant explanations, and appeal.
5. **AI should incorporate privacy design principles.**: Google will give opportunity for notice and consent, encourage architectures with privacy safeguards, and provide appropriate transparency and control over the use of data.
6. **AI should uphold high standards of scientific excellence.**: Google will work with a range of stakeholders to promote thoughtful leadership in this area, during on scientifically rigorous and multi-disciplinary approaches.Google will responsibly share AI knowledge by publishing educational materials, best practices, and research thus enable more people to develop useful AI applications.
7. **AI should be made available for uses that accord with these principles.**:Many technologies have multiple uses.We'll work to limit potentially harmful or abusive applications.

In addition to these seven principles, there are certain AI applications that Google will not pursue. Google will not design or deploy AI in these four application areas : Technologies that cause or are likely to cause overall harm. 
Weapons or other technologies whose principal purpose or implementation is to cause or directly facilitate injury to people. Technologies that gather or use information for surveillance that violates internationally accepted norms, and technologies whose purpose contravene is widely accepted principles of international law and human rights. Establishing principles was a starting point rather than an end.
What remains true is that our AI principles rarely give Google direct answers, to Google questions on how to build our products.
   
They don't and shouldn't allow us to sidestep hard conversations.They are a foundation that establishes what Google stand for, what Google build, and why Google build it.


They are core to the success of our enterprise AI offerings.
